setting project
    - vs code
    - java
    - oracle database
    - docker
    - maven or gradle (need to download maven, extract, and add path variable to bin directory)

https://spring.io/guides/tutorials/rest
download latest jdk from oracle

install spring initialzr from vs code extensions
create project with spring initializr in vscode's command pallete
add dependencies:
    - spring web //rest operations
    - spring data jpa //data operations
    - oracle driver //connect to oracle database
------------------------------------
//set up database

install Oracle Developer Tools for VS Code from vs code extensions
install oracle database: use docker to pull container image
run oracle database image in docker with custom config to set password
    - reference: search for oracle container registry page in oracle website
    - docker run -d -p <host_port>:<container_port> --name <container_name> -e <password_variable>=<password_value> <image_name>
        p option publishes the container's port to the host allows for the port running the container to be allows traffic directed at host port to be forwarded to the container's port making the container's service accessible from outside the container
    - docker run -d -p 1521:1521 --name oracle-docker -e ORACLE_PWD=sys123 container-registry.oracle.com/database/free:latest

set password in case default was not set
    - in docker exec window, run ./setPassword.sh <password>

check that user can be connected from within the docker container using exec window
    - command to connect: sqlplus sys@localhost:1521/FREEPDB1 as sysdba

References:
    - Connect string format: [username]@[hostname]:[port]/[DB service name] [AS SYSDBA]
    - command to connect: sqlplus sys@localhost:1521/FREEPDB1 as sysdba
    - username: sys
    - password: oracle
    - hostname: localhost
    - port = 1521
    - db service name: database = FREEPDB1

click oracle explorer (or SQL Developer) in vs code left icon menu
create new database connection
    - service name: from the docker image = FREEPDB1
    - role: SYSDBA
    - username: sys
    - password: set from docker run command or resetting password

//run container
docker start <container_name>
------------------------
//database set up

create table in Oracle Expolorer
    - right click the database name -> open new sql file

//add dependency to project
src\main\resources\application.properties
    - add oracle database port and log in info

----------------------
//dependency set up

for gradle project
    - edit the build.gradle file

for maven project
    - edit the pom.xml file

-------------------------
//learnings

getters from Entity class create the json data response

in service tests, Mockito when() method allows for stubbing which provides control for the behavior of a specific method called
in this case, the Mock field is the repository so stubbing can control the actions taken when repository's methods are invoked

------------------------
//running tests
1. start oracle-docker container in docker
2. run tests
-------------------------
//running program
1. start database with docker (to-do-db2)
2. start java program
3. use postman to send requests
